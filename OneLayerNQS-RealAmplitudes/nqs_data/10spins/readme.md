* contains data for trials conducted for 10 spin TFI model with open boundary conditions.
    - The ansatz used in One-layer Feed Forward Neural Network.
    - trails were coducted by varying the alpha and number of iterations value. (only on antiferromagnetic trails)

* antiferromagnetic models was found to be not be converging with iterations (based of $\hat{R}$ value).
* we found no improvement in the result while increasing alpha value.
