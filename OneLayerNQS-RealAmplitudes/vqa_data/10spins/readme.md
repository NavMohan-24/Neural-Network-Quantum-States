* contains data for trials conducted for 10 spin TFI model with open boundary conditions.
    - The ansatz used in RealAmplitude.
    - circuit depth was fixed as 4 repetition (repetation of ry and entanglement blocks)
    - Trails were conducted varying the maxiter value of optimization routine on both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic models
