* contains data for trials conducted for 15 spin TFI model with open boundary conditions
    - The ansatz used in RealAmplitude.
    - Trails was conducted by varying the circuit depth reps = 4,6,8 (only on antiferromagnetic case)
    - maxiter was fixed to be a constant = 300 

* in the trails we observed accuracy to detoriate with the circuit depth.
* maxiter value was fixed to 300 since we want to compare it with NQS which converges to a value with 300 iterations.
